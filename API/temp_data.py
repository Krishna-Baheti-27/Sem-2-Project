    'title': 'Markets Tumble as Three-Day Selloff Wipes Out $9.5 Trillion',
    'body': '(Bloomberg) -- The carnage in financial markets worsened on Monday with stressed-out investors abandoning hopes that President Donald Trump would change his tariff policy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nStocks tumbled, taking the three-day wipeout in global equity value to about $9.5 trillion. S&P 500 equity futures signaled a 3% loss and the VIX Index spiked above 50. Europe\'s Stoxx 600 tumbled 5%. Asia capped the worst day since 2008. Treasuries and the yen gained as investors sought refuge.\n\nTraders boosted their expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year, pricing in the equivalent to five quarter-point moves. Swaps also showed the risk of an emergency move, reflecting a 40% chance of a cut by next week, well before the Fed\'s meeting in May.\n\nTrump\'s determination over the weekend to go ahead with tariffs despite recession warnings from prominent economists and criticism from hedge fund managers, like supporter Bill Ackman, added to a sense that there\'s little chance of the president rolling back his strategy. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday to "forget markets for a second" in a flash of disregard for the selloff engulfing Wall Street.\n\n"It starts to feel as if the market is getting into a \'sell now, ask questions later\' kind of mood," said Stephan Kemper, chief investment strategist at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. "The market is looking for the point of max pain at which the Trump administration and/or the Fed start to blink."\n\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\n\nMarkets around the world buckled from the selloff. Tesla Inc. shares plunged as much as 10% after Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and long-time bull, slashed his price target. Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Citigroup Inc. dropped about 5%.\n\nEurope\'s Stoxx 600 Index plunged to the lowest since December 2023 and Germany\'s DAX Index briefly sank 10% before recovering. Defense companies, some of the best-performing stocks this year, were among the hit hardest as investors built cash by selling winners.\n\nIn Asia, the Hang Seng Index sank 13% and South Korea also briefly halted sell orders for program trading. China\'s policymakers discussed measures over the weekend to stabilize the economy and the markets, including whether to accelerate plans to unleash stimulus to bolster consumption, according to people familiar with the matter.',

    'title': "US Stock Futures Slump Following Massive Tariff-Induced Selloff: Experts Warn Of A Brewing 'Great Depression-Like' Pattern - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
    'body': 'U.S. stock futures fell sharply on Monday after two days of decline last week. Futures of major benchmark indices were over 3% lower in premarket trading.\n\nThe selloff that started on Thursday intensified on Friday as China introduced its retaliatory measures to U.S. tariffs. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was nearing the bear market zone as it closed 17.46% lower than its previous record high of 6,147.43 points.\n\nDow was 14.99% down from its 52-week high of 45,073.63 points, whereas the Nasdaq 100 was already in the bear market territory, 21.71% lower from its high of 22,222.61 points.\n\nThe hopes of a Fed \'put\' remained on standby as Jerome Powell said Friday that "It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy."\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yielded 3.93% and the two-year bond was at 3.51%. However, the CME Group\'s FedWatch tool\'s projections rose, showing markets pricing a 48.4% likelihood of the Federal Reserve easing the current interest rates in its May meeting.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, declined in premarket on Monday. The SPY was down 4.01% to $485.03, while the QQQ declined 4.26% to $404.65, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nCues From Last Session:\n\nU.S. stocks closed Friday lower, with all sectors in the red. Financials, energy, and information technology led the S&P 500 sector declines.\n\nFriday\'s economic data showed strong March nonfarm payroll growth grew 228,000, exceeding expectations, though the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.2%, and average hourly earnings increased as predicted by 0.3% monthly, and 3.8% year-over-year.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index recorded its worst weekly decline since March 2020. With the S&P 500 plunging 10.5% over Thursday and Friday, this marks only the fourth time such a sharp two-day drawdown has occurred in modern market history -- joining October 1987, September 2008, March 2020, and now April 2025.\n\nInsights From Analysts:\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow are showing a worrying pattern of steep, consecutive drops, reminiscent of the Great Depression, according to the experts.\n\nCarson Research\'s chief market strategist, Ryan Detrick, noted on X that a 4% drop in the S&P 500 on Monday would be its third straight over 4% loss, a pattern seen only three times before, all during the Great Depression.\n\nWhite Oak Consultancy\'s Jason Goepfert pointed out that Dow futures suggest a third consecutive loss exceeding 3%, a pattern seen only four times during the Great Depression.\n\nThe Sentimentrader graph shared by hi, shows varied Dow performance in the weeks and months following these rare historical sell-off signals, highlighting market uncertainty even after such events.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Craig Shapiro from 3-Circle Investments by The Bear Traps Report, the absence of this perceived "Trump put" or "Fed put" could trigger a swift and significant market downturn.\n\nShapiro argues the market sought assurance from Trump or the Fed, but recent events show both safety nets are further away than expected. He predicts Fed intervention only if the Treasury market becomes unstable.\n\nShapiro warned, "All this being said, the lack of the \'put\' for now means I think we are going to go significantly lower very quickly until UsT market dysfunction starts and the Fed says \'no mas\' because this will eventually bleed into economic activity and exacerbate the slowdown."\n\nDespite growing skepticism, Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist and the head of investment solutions at Hightower Advisors, said, "Buy."\n\nSee Also: How to Trade Futures\n\nUpcoming Economic Data\n\nHere\'s what investors will keep an eye on this week:\n\nOn Monday, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler will speak at 10:30 a.m. ET.

    'title': "Is Tesla Cybertruck The Biggest Automotive Blunder In Decades After Ford's Edsel? 'It's A Huge Swing And A Huge Miss' - Ford Motor (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM)",
    'body': 'Tesla Inc.\'s TSLA Cybertruck, a brainchild of Elon Musk, has been dubbed the auto industry\'s most significant flop in decades, according to a report.\n\nWhat Happened: The auto industry has seen many infamous flops, including Ford\'s F Edsel and Pinto, GM\'s GM Pontiac Aztek, and the Delorean DMC-12. Now, Musk\'s Tesla Cybertruck is being added to that list of failures, according to Forbes. Musk\'s angular pickup truck fell short of his ambitious sales target by a massive 84%, with no signs of a turnaround in sight.\n\nThe vehicle\'s sales have drastically underperformed Musk\'s predictions, and its quality reputation has been marred by eight recalls within the past 13 months. Despite Musk\'s ambitious forecast of 250,000 annual sales, Tesla managed to sell just under 40,000 Cybertrucks in 2024, its inaugural year on the market. The sales trend has continued to dip in 2025, contributing to a 13% decline in Tesla\'s overall sales in Q1.\n\nExperts explained that the Cybertruck is either too big or doesn\'t meet pedestrian safety regulations in certain countries, limiting its potential for increased sales through exports.\n\nEric Noble, president of CARLAB, likened the Cybertruck\'s failure to Ford\'s infamous Edsel, stating, "It\'s right up there with Edsel". "It\'s a huge swing and a huge miss," added Noble.\n\nThe Cybertruck\'s flop is not solely due to poor sales and quality issues but is also attributed to Musk\'s contentious politics and job-cutting role at DOGE, which have incited worldwide Tesla protests.\n\nSEE ALSO: Tom Lee Slams Trump\'s \'Absurd\' Tariff Hike -- Expects A \'Recovery\' But Says Timing Is Uncertain As Market Sheds $2.5 Trillion In A Day\n\nWhy It Matters: Despite Musk\'s claim of over a million reservations for the Cybertruck, Tesla\'s estimates of massive demand has proven to be misguided. The vehicle\'s size and non-compliance with some countries\' pedestrian safety rules have curtailed its potential for overseas sales. Glenn Mercer, the head of Cleveland-based advisory firm GM Automotive, stated, "They haven\'t sold a lot and it\'s unlikely in this case that overseas markets can save them."\n\nFurther, the Cybertruck\'s sales have been adversely impacted by recall-related fixes, with a starting price of $82,000. Tesla\'s overall sales have also taken a hit this year, with deliveries falling 13% in the first quarter to 337,000 units, significantly below consensus expectations of 408,000.\n\nEarlier this year, Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, highlighted Tesla\'s struggling Cybertruck sales in a social media post, noting figures significantly below company projections. "Tesla has sold only 47k Cybertrucks total according to the recall notice. This is really bad for a product that was supposed to sell 250k units a year," Gerber wrote.\n\nTesla has a momentum rating of 93.32% and a quality rating of 97.03%, according to Benzinga\'s Proprietary Edge Rankings.

    'title': "Tesla shares plunge below Lutnick's 'never this cheap' level",
    'body': 'Tesla Inc.\'s stock extended losses in early trading Monday, dropping below a price at which Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted they\'d never fall to again.\n\nThe shares plunged more than 10% to $214.80 amid a broader rout in global equity markets. Lutnick said during a Fox News interview on March 19 -- when Tesla closed at $235.86 -- that viewers should buy the stock, saying "it\'ll never be this cheap again." Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told Tesla employees the following day that they should hang on to their shares.\n\nThe latest decline comes after one of Tesla\'s biggest bulls -- Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives -- slashed his price target on the stock by more than 40%, citing Trump\'s trade policies and a brand crisis created by Musk.\n\nTesla shares have fallen 50% from a record high reached in mid-December. The stock had surged following Trump\'s election victory, which many expected to be a boon for the company, given Musk\'s proximity to the then president-elect. Instead, Musk\'s involvement in political controversies both in the US and abroad has repelled some car buyers and spurred protests against the company.\n\nLast week, Tesla reported first-quarter vehicle deliveries that failed to meet drastically lowered expectations, falling to the lowest level since 2022. JPMorgan Chase & Co.\'s Ryan Brinkman -- one of Wall Street\'s most bearish analysts on the stock -- said that he may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction and "unprecedented brand damage."\n\nSeveral analysts have lowered their estimates for Tesla\'s sales and earnings in recent weeks, even before the company reported weak vehicle-delivery numbers. And while Tesla is seen as relatively insulated from the 25% tariffs announced by Trump on imported autos, Musk has warned the company won\'t be unscathed.\n\n"The tariffs in their current form will disrupt Tesla, the overall supply chain, and its global footprint which has been a clear advantage over the years versus rising competitors like BYD," Wedbush\'s Ives said in a note to clients on Sunday.\n\nThe bigger worry, according to Ives, is Tesla\'s position in China.\n\n"The backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk\'s association will be hard to understate, and this will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng, and others," Ives wrote.',

    'title': "Trump's 'Reciprocal' Tariff Threat Wipes Out Nearly $1.8 Trillion From Magnificent 7, Dan Ives Warns It Could Set US Tech Back A Decade: 'Investors Know Math And The Sad Reality' - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
    'body': 'Last week, Donald Trump announced "reciprocal" tariffs that have caused significant turbulence in global markets, with the stock prices of major U.S. tech companies, known as the "Magnificent 7," plummeting and wiping out nearly $1.8 trillion in market value.\n\nWhat Happened: On Sunday, Dan Ives, an analyst from Wedbush Securities, warned that Trump\'s tariffs could severely hinder the U.S. tech sector\'s growth.\n\nIves underscored the long-term impact of the trade policies, stating, "Investors know math and the sad reality" -- suggesting the U.S. tech industry could be set back by a decade if these tariffs remain in place.\n\nTrump\'s reciprocal tariff strategy, which includes a 10% universal tariff on all imports and additional duties targeting countries like China, India, and the EU, sparked a massive sell-off in the stock market.\n\nSee Also: Apple Making iPhones In America A Fantasy That Sounds Great \'Behind The Microphones,\' Says Top Analyst Dan Ives\n\nThe S&P 500, which represents some of the largest companies in the U.S., lost $5 trillion in market value, with key companies in the tech sector suffering heavy losses.\n\nTheir collective market cap erosion of Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Nvidia Corp.NVDA, and Tesla Inc. TSLA amounted to a staggering $1.8 trillion, with Apple losing $534 billion alone.\n\nWhy It Matters: The tariffs have far-reaching consequences, especially for the U.S. tech sector, which relies heavily on global supply chains. Apple, for example, could see the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max soar from $1,599 to around $2,300, according to industry analysts.\n\nFurthermore, the tariffs could push tech companies to reconsider their operations and manufacturing locations. While the U.S. government is betting on reshoring jobs, the increasing cost of labor and the slow pace of manufacturing build-outs could mean limited job growth, particularly with increasing automation.\n\nIves previously pointed out that tech earnings would likely decline by 15%, and the price of consumer electronics could rise by up to 50%, burdening American consumers.\n\nDespite a robust U.S. labor market that added 228,000 jobs in March, escalating trade tensions have cast a shadow over the positive economic momentum.\n\nComparisons to the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 -- which deepened the Great Depression -- are fueling concerns about the broader global economic outlook.\n\nRead Next:\n\nTim Cook Praises China\'s DeepSeek For Driving Efficiency, Stresses Apple\'s \'Prudent And Deliberate\' Approach Toward Capital Expenditure\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\nAAPLApple Inc$180.20-4.34%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?\n\nBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock - anytime.\n\nReveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum77.15Growth44.98Quality83.61Value7.46Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewAMZNAmazon.com Inc$163.74-4.25%GOOGAlphabet Inc$141.32-4.35%GOOGLAlphabet Inc$139.60-4.12%METAMeta Platforms Inc$481.50-4.60%MSFTMicrosoft Corp$343.72-4.48%NVDANVIDIA Corp$89.41-5.20%TSLATesla Inc$222.50-7.07%Got Questions?

    'body': 'The CNN Money Fear and Greed index showed further decline in the overall market sentiment, while the index remained in the "Extreme Fear" zone on Friday.\n\nU.S. stocks settled lower on Thursday, with the Dow Jones index tumbling over 2,200 points during the session.\n\nTesla Inc. TSLA shares dipped over 10% on Friday, Nvidia Corp. NVDA lost 7.4%, while Apple Inc. AAPL dipped 7.3% during the session.\n\nOn the economic data front, in March, nonfarm payrolls surged by 228,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The outcome is well above the three-month average of 195,000 and topped economists\' forecasts of 135,000. February\'s employment growth was downwardly revised to 117,000. The unemployment rate unexpectedly inched higher from 4.1% to 4.2%, defying expectations for no change. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3% from February\'s pace, as predicted, and rose 3.8% year-over-year, marginally lower than the 3.9% predicted.\n\nMost sectors on the S&P 500 closed on a negative note, with financial, energy, and information technology stocks recording the biggest losses on Friday.

It is based on the premise that higher fear exerts pressure on stock prices, while higher greed has the opposite effect. The index is calculated based on seven equal-weighted indicators.

    'title': "EU Reportedly Set to Fine Elon Musk's X Over $1 Billion for Violating New Digital Act; X Labels It 'An Unprecedented Act of Political Censorship' - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
    'body': 'The European Union is reportedly preparing to levy a hefty fine on X, a social network owned by Elon Musk. The fine, which could exceed $1 billion, is expected to be announced this summer.\n\nWhat Happened: This penalty would be the first under the new EU law. The fine could exceed $1 billion as regulators seek to discourage other companies from breaching the Digital Services Act, reported The New York Times.\n\nA source told the publication that the European regulators "..want it to be big enough to pressure other companies to comply with the law."\n\nThe European Commission concluded last year that X had breached the Digital Services Act, aimed at tackling unlawful content and misinformation. The regulators are now deliberating on the appropriate penalty. "The penalties are set to include a fine and demands for product changes," the Times reported, citing four individuals familiar with the plans.\n\nX\'s global government affairs account hit back at the European regulators on Friday. "If the reports that the European Commission is considering enforcement actions against X are accurate, it represents an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech," X stated.\n\nSEE ALSO: Howard Lutnick Says Army Of Millions Will Build iPhones In The US, But Could Trump\'s Tariffs Make The Premium Apple Flagship Cost $2,300?\n\nAdditionally, a separate EU investigation is ongoing, building a case that X\'s lax approach to monitoring user-generated content has made it a hub for illegal hate speech and disinformation, potentially leading to further penalties.\n\nWhy It Matters: The EU launched a formal investigation into X in December 2023 to examine possible violations of the Digital Services Act, focusing on areas such as risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency, and researcher access to data.\n\nNotably, in late March, the European regulators decided to impose minimal fines on Apple Inc. AAPL and Meta META To avoid any pushback from the Trump administration.\n\nThis development comes on the heels of Elon Musk\'s other ventures facing challenges in Europe. Earlier this month, Tesla Inc. TSLA witnessed a decline in sales in key European markets for three consecutive months. This downturn has been attributed to increasing competition from China and backlash against Musk\'s political activities.\n\nWith the EU\'s impending fine on X, Musk\'s business interests in Europe could face further headwinds. The fine and potential product changes could have significant implications for X and other tech companies operating in the region.\n\nREAD MORE: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Says Stock Market Decline Is Due To China\'s DeepSeek, Not Trump\'s Policies: \'Mag 7 Problem, Not A MAGA Problem\' - Benzinga\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nAAPLApple Inc$186.60-0.94%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?\n\nBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock - anytime.\n\nReveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum77.15Growth44.98Quality83.61Value7.46Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMETAMeta Platforms Inc$500.15-0.91%TSLATesla Inc$235.25-1.75%Got Questions?

    'title': "Trump Advisor Navarro Hits Back At Elon Musk's Tariff Criticism: 'Just Looking Out For His Own Interests' - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)",
    'body': 'Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk has publicly voiced his criticism of Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro over President Donald Trump\'s tariffs. Navarro, however, has denied any feud with Musk.\n\nWhat Happened: Early Saturday Musk on his social media platform X questioned Navarro\'s support of Trump\'s tariffs. Musk, who has generally been supportive of President Donald Trump, has not previously commented on the President\'s trade policies and their effect on the stock market.\n\nAn X user posted a video of Navarro defending the administration\'s tariff calculations while praising the trade adviser\'s PhD in economics from Harvard. Musk responded to the video, implying that Navarro\'s Harvard economics PhD was a disadvantage.\n\nMusk also responded "yup" to a post that quoted economist Thomas Sowell, stating, "In every disaster throughout American history, there always seems to be a man from Harvard in the middle of it."\n\nMeanwhile, when asked on Fox News about Musk\'s remarks and a possible disagreement, Navarro responded, "It\'s fine, there\'s no rift here." He further suggested that Musk, as a businessman, was "simply protecting his own interest" by opposing him and Trump\'s tariffs.\n\n"Elon is great when he sticks to his DOGE lane," Navarro said, but stated that the billionaire "sells cars" and is "just looking out for his own interests" by opposing him and Trump\'s tariffs -- "just like any businessperson would."\n\nSEE ALSO: Howard Lutnick Says Army Of Millions Will Build iPhones In The US, But Could Trump\'s Tariffs Make The Premium Apple Flagship Cost $2,300?\n\nWhy It Matters: Musk\'s remarks surfaced as he has largely refrained from the tariff discussion. However, he later expressed a desire for the U.S. and Europe to move toward a zero-tariff system, in response to Trump\'s imposition of a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union.\n\nMusk\'s net worth has taken a significant hit following Trump\'s tariff announcement, with billions wiped off. Despite this, Forbes still ranks the billionaire as the world\'s richest person, with an estimated net worth of $362.5 billion as of Sunday. Tesla\'s stock plunged nearly 15% between Trump\'s tariff announcement on Wednesday and Friday\'s close at $239.43.\n\nIn March, Musk acknowledged that although his auto company leads in U.S. manufacturing compared to competitors, "Tesla is still significantly impacted by tariffs." Meanwhile, shares of Musk\'s SpaceX, a privately held company, dropped 12% last week, as reported by secondary market data provider Notice. The decline is linked to SpaceX\'s reliance on products sourced from Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand -- countries heavily impacted by Trump\'s tariffs.\n\nREAD NEXT: Mark Cuban Says Between \'Free Trade\' Elon Musk And \'Full Tariff\' Trump, It Is The President Who Will Win As Stocks Futures Tank\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nTSLATesla Inc$235.25-1.75%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?\n\nBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock - anytime.\n\nReveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum93.32Growth67.63Quality97.03Value10.46Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewGot Questions?

What if something that bad-or worse-happens again? In the guest post below, our friend David Janello, PhD, CFA, has a suggestion for how you can protect against that.\n\nDr. Janello is the founder of SpreadHunter, and the author of The Nuclear Option: Trading To Win With Options Momentum Strategies.\n\nAuthored by David Janello, PhD, CFA at Nuclear Options Trading.\n\nProtecting Against A 1987-Style Crash\n\nWith the market continuing its relentless drive lower, there are a few outcomes that can unfold over the next week or two. Here are option trades (with fill prices) to capture extreme profits in one or more of these scenarios. But equally important, we look at trades to avoid because of poor pricing.\n\nThe most likely possibilities for the market in the near future are:\n\nA sharp move higher, from extreme oversold conditions (no news) A violent move higher, based on a truce in the ongoing trade war A continuous move straight down for 30-90 days, like 2022 Or a violent move lower, on either no news or an acceleration in the trade war The More Likely Scenarios\n\nIn our opinion, Scenarios 1 and 2 are the most likely to occur. Unfortunately, the options pricing to capture these moves is extremely poor, which generates mediocre profits even if the forecast comes true.\n\nRecall that we discussed the 2022 Scenario discussed in an earlier Nuclear Option Substack post, with an example bearish trade in TSLA that was profitable. And because of the potential for a violent move up (on tariff / trade war truce) we would avoid re-initiating this trade because of the extremely high risk.\n\nThe final scenario, a violent move lower, perhaps Monday at the open (like 1987) is the only scenario with decently priced spread trades.\n\nOur favorite trade from this morning was this:\n\nLong VIX Index 70-90 Call Vertical Spread Expiring April 16 at 0.20.\n\nThis trade risks 20- for a 2000- potential gain. Although it is a low probability trade, the potential profits more than make up for it. If we get a 1987 type crash on Monday morning, this is the trade have.\n\nNOTE: You can only trade VIX Index Options and Complex Spreads on the CBOE Exchange.\n\nAlgorithmic Trades:\n\nVisa (V) 255 Put 255 Strike Put Calendar Apr 17-Apr25 day traded for a 142% profit earlier.
